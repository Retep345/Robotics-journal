## Markdown
markdown is a text editing syntax that simplifies HTML coding for ease of use and speed.

* Headings are done with \# with 1 used for the main header and increasing ammounts for subsiquent headers to denote importance /(two for a secondary header, 3 for tertiary, so on)

* using a \\ leaves the symbol unedited for visual or literal use.

* *italics* and **bold** use \*'s either end, 1 for italics and two for bold

* bulletpoints use a single \* at the start

* number lists use \1. or any number to organise like a bullet point list

>block
>quotes use the \> at the start

* using 3 \' change the text into a code format, such as javascript

'''javascript
function test()
'''

* -[x] a tick box is done with an x between square brackets
  -[ ] an unticked box is done without the x

* a url can be attached using a \! before a given name in a square bracket and a url in a curved bracket ![example](https://resourcestore.plymouth.ac.uk/plymouth/file/7c3d1218-d1f5-4259-be18-bf82ecc2323a/1/1-git-linux-cmd-line.pdf) using the practical pdf


## Electric Motor
using copper loops and magnets, we plan to create an electric motor.

1. put nail into either flat end of a cork core

2. apply 2 strips of copper tape at one end with a gap between. these act as a **commutator**

3. using large paperclips, create a rack to hold the nails to act as an axis of rotation

4. face magnets so that they attract, but spaced away from eachother either rounded side of the central rotor

5. apply current using wires touching commutator
